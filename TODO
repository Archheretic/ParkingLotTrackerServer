Before first release:
- Authorization on all non GET api endpoints.
- Add total historical amount of parked cars on that spesific parkingLot to the parkingLog
- fix api/v0/parkinglogs/latest to be spesific for each parkingLot foreignkey, perhaps also allow for non spesific?
- Tests that covers the three previous TODOs
- Add a version number (to the readme file?)
